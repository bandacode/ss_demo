# ss_test

A demo project for Smart Saver job application

## Getting Started

This project is a demonstration of how I structure my projects. It is a simple flutter application that pulls restaurants and reviews from an API.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have flutter installed on your machine. You can find instructions on how to do that here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

### Installing

Clone the repository

```
git clone
```

Install dependencies

```
flutter pub get
```

Run the app

```
flutter run
```

You will need to change the API url in the `lib/config.dart` file to point to your local API server.
